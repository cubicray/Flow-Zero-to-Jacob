> 1. Safety and Security
> 2. Clarity
> 3. Approachability
> 4. Developer Experience
> 5. Resource Oriented Programming

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

> 1. Safety and Security: Since Smart Contracts are irreversible, they must be secure and reliable to ensure the safety of users and their assets when transacting on the blockchain.
> 2. Clarity: Being able to write code that is clear and organized improves readability, which allows for better review and reuse of the code to ensure there are no mistakes that could lead to security problems later on.
> 3. Approachability: A programming language that looks and feels familiar allows for faster adoption by developers who already have experience with other programming languages.
> 4. Developer Experience: Similarly, a good DX affects overall usage and adoption by enabling developers to be more productive with features such as easy-to-use debug tools and clear error messages.
