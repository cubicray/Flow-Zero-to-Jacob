> answer

2. In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the `/public/` path.
> answer

3. Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:

    1) In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface. 

    2) Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.

    3) Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.

```swift
contract
```

```swift
transaction
```

```swift
script 1
```

```swift
script 2
```
