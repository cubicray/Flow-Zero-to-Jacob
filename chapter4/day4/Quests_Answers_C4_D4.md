## Quests Answers - Chapter 4, Day 4

Above, when I was talking about the difficulty of sending a transaction with 2 signers, I wrote this:

```
The only problem here is that it's *usually* not good practice to require two signers in a transaction. This is because it's difficult to get multiple people to sign the same transaction in a reasonable time frame. We will go much more in-depth on this at a later point, but for now, we can leave it at that.
```

Can you brainstorm any ways to distribute `Minter`s to other people WITHOUT having to have 2 signers, or in other words, 2 `AuthAccount`s? If you can't that is okay. But try your best to come up with something. We will learn this later down the road as well.
